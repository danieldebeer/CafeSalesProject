# Cafe Sales Project â˜• ðŸ“Š
New York City coffee shop transactional sales data analysis and forecasting.

<br>

### Business Scenario:
The owner of a chain of New York City coffee shops would to analyse the transactional sales data for the month of April 2019.

Project Outcomes:
1. The owner wants sales informative insights into product and store performance in order to assess productivity and profitabilty.
  - Data wrangling and cleaning in SQL
  - KPI Dashboard in Tableau

2. Additionally, the owner would then like to investigate the influence of weather on sales traffic by creating a model that could predict daily sales count (number of sales) based on atmospheric weather conditions in order to forecast future sales patterns. The owner wants to use this sales forcasting to effectively plan staffing and stock in order to **maximise the profit margin**.
  - Sales prediction using multiple linear regression in python


<br>

### Data:
The dataset used is a summary table of daily sales from the IBM coffee shop dataset and NASA weather condition recordings for April 2019.

**NB:** Please note I do take into consideration that this dataset is small and therefore more data will be needed for statistical significance of the findings, however, this project serves as a prelimanary sales forcasting study.
