# Cafe Sales Project
New York City coffee shop transactional sales data analysis and forecasting.

<br>

### Business Scenario:
The owner of a chain of New York City coffee shops would to investigate the influence of weather on sales traffic. The owner would like to create a model that could predict daily sales count (number of sales) based on atmospheric weather conditions in order to forecast future sales patterns. The owner could use this sales forcasting to effectively plan staffing and stock to **maximise the profit margin**.

A linear regression model was choosen as we are wanting to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable.

In this notebook, we'll build a multiple linear regression model to predict **Daily Sales Count** using appropriate **weather predictor variables**.

### Data:
The dataset used is a summary table of daily sales from the IBM coffee shop dataset and NASA weather condition recordings for April 2019.

**NB:** Please note I do take into consideration that this dataset is small and therefore more data will be needed for statistical significance of the findings, however, this project serves as a prelimanary sales forcasting study.

### Project Layout:
The project is dividend into three parts;
  1. Data cleaning, manipulation and wrangling using **SQL**
  2. Data visualisation using **Tableau**
  3. Sales Prediction using weather condition variables in **Python**
